    <h2>Main Content</h2>
    <p>Rainbow Six: Siege is an objective based video game in which two teams try to either defend or attack three different styles of objective, a hostage, bomb or biohazard container. The game tries to be as realistic as possible by including destructable maps, a realistic physics engine and gameplay meachanics supporting tactics used by real life counter terror units such as the American Navy Seals or the British Special Air Service. One of the gmes main strengths is its variety of character to play as, each with their own unique and useful ability ranging from a jammer that shuts down enemy drones to a sledge hammer capable of breaking hole in destructable walls.</p>
