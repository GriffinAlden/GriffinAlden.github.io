    <h2>Development</h2>
    <p>The Development of Rainbow Six: Siege was led by Ubisoft Montreal. One of the main focuses in the development of this game was realism so before anything else the development team studied historical counter terrorist operations such as the iranian embassy atack in and the moscow theatre hostage crisis. Due to the destructable nature of the environtments there were many problems with glitches in which certain objects such as walls and floors with poor hit detection but most of these issues were fixed within a few weeks of release. Development started in 2011 with a planned predecessor that ended up becoming the full release in 2015.</p>
    
    <h2>Post Release Changes</h2>
    <p>One unique feature that Rainbow Six: Siege uses to keep a stable playerbase is major post-release content updates. Every few months there is n upadate released that provides all players with a free new map and 2 free new characters, along with significant bug fixes this system has kept the playerbase stable for almost 2 years</p>
